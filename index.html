<h1>A Semantic Model for Actions and Event in Ambient Intelligence</h1>
<p>Based on our conviction that <em>event management</em> and <em>response generation</em> are two essential aspects of
systems for Ambient Intelligence, we propose here a <strong>semantic model</strong>
for actions and events as a way of handling these issues. Basically, our semantic model describes
what actions and events are, how they are connected, and how
computational systems should think
about their meaning. </p>

<p>This model entails an approach with which to both reason about and model context
events and generate behavioral responses to those events, when necessary. The
model supports this ad-hoc response generation by
<strong>automatically composing</strong> services when those which are available do not meet the
expected functionality (without requesting user
intervention). </p>

<p>The great potential of the proposed semantic model is founded on its
fulfillment of the inter-module connectivity and
communication requirements of a framework for Ambient
Intelligence. In our endeavor to show the
impact that automatic service composition has on the achievement of
autonomous, self-managed, and pro-active systems, we propose an optional implementation that makes use of
several technologies: ZeroC ICE, JADEX, and Scone. The only purpose of this optional implementation is showing the
feasibility of our proposal and to show the reader how to map the proposed theorethical semantic model into
a concrete system.  </p>

<h2>The Semantic Model</h2>
<p>Our main contribution is twofold with regard to the
semantic model. First, we propose a non-coupled semantic
model. Second, as mentioned in the paper,  we are convinced that
the notion of event, action or service should not vary among systems, nor
should they respond to the mere approach convenience. For that reason,
we follow a novel approach proposing a semantic model for Ambient
Intelligence based on the conclusions, concerning actions and events,
drawn from the philosophical doctrine. In contrast to what can be
found in the literature revision, our model is formally based and
justified on philosophical studies. </p>

<p>From a computing perspective, a <strong>semantic model</strong> is considered to
be an agreement on how to interpret the knowledge represented in the
knowledge base. Semantic models therefore ensure common
interpretations of shared knowledge. They are also an essential requirement 
when there are different instances handling the same knowledge. Every
holder is expected to extract the same meaning or conclusions from the
represented knowledge. </p>


<p>Having said that, the following section provides a more formal expression 
of the proposed semantic model, along with the justification of why the proposed 
semantic model is considered to be common-sense compliant.</p>

<h2>Implementation Guidelines</h2>
<p>The following subsections analyze those modules, paying particular
attention to the implications of the semantic model and the different
strategies followed for its implementation.</p>


<p>Furthermore, the following sequence diagrams, provide an overview of the interaction among the different modules. </p>

<h3>The Multi-Agent System</h3>
<p>The Multi-Agent System (MAS) works as a link between the
Ambient Intelligence environment and the other elements of which the
Ambient Intelligence framework is composed. The MAS is basically in
charge of adopting the plan as outlined by the planning algorithm,
and undertaking it. The interaction with the other architectural
elements is, once again, supported in the semantic model. At the
MAS level, the semantic model is implemented by means of
an OWL ontology. The Agent Communication Language (ACL)
messages, exchanged among agents, therefore contain classes of the
ontology, which are simultaneously concepts of the semantic model.</p>

<p>We have used <a href="http://jadex-agents.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/xwiki/bin/view/About/Overview" name="Jadex" title="Jadex">Jadex</a>, a BDI Agent System that 
allows to develop goal oriented agents following the BDI model.
